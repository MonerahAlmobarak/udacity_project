Deployment Option Analysis: VM vs App Service
    Virtual Machine (VM)
        Cost: Generally more expensive due to hourly compute charges, licensing fees, and always-on infrastructure. You also need to manually manage startup and shutdown to optimize cost.

        Scalability: Requires manual setup for scaling, such as configuring load balancers and creating VM scale sets. Not ideal for quick or automatic scaling.

        Availability: High availability is achievable but requires manual configuration, such as multiple VMs across regions and custom failover strategies.

        Workflow: Offers full control over the environment, including the operating system and installed software. However, it also requires more effort to manage dependencies, web servers, security patches, and updates.

    App Service
        Cost: More cost-efficient, especially for development and small- to medium-scale applications. Offers free and shared tiers for testing.

        Scalability: Auto-scaling is built-in and easy to configure. Scaling up or out can be done with a few clicks or through automation.

        Availability: High availability is provided by default, with built-in load balancing and a guaranteed SLA.

        Workflow: Simple deployment options such as ZIP deploy, GitHub Actions, or Azure CLI. Requires minimal configuration and maintenance.

Chosen Solution: App Service
    I chose Azure App Service to deploy the CMS application because it provides a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to deploy Python applications. It offers a streamlined deployment process with minimal setup and maintenance requirements. Auto-scaling and integrated logging make it a practical choice for most use cases in development and production environments.

Conditions for Choosing a VM Instead
    I would consider deploying to a Virtual Machine if the application required a custom server environment, system-level dependencies, or advanced control over the operating system and infrastructure. For example, if the application needed a background service or non-standard configuration that App Service cannot support, a VM would be more suitable. Additionally, in enterprise scenarios with strict networking or security requirements, a VM setup may be necessary.
